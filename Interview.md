Rules to prepare:

1) **Be succinct, honest and engaging.**
I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.

2) **Use the job description to prepare.**
Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.

3) **Tie your story to their needs.**
People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.


- Tell me about yourself?
For the past three and a half years, I've been dedicated to learning programming, starting with Java. My interest in programming was sparked by my fascination with tasks like scripting and building SQL queries. In 2020, I took the opportunity to dive into the programming world, and I consider myself fortunate to have had a mentor with over 20 years of Java programming experience by my side. This mentor not only provided valuable guidance but also helped shape my approach to programming.

One of the most important lessons I learned from my mentor was the importance of seeking efficient solutions, embracing new technologies without bias, and delving into the core of any technology. Java, for instance, forms the foundation for many technologies.

In terms of my personal qualities, I prefer not to self-evaluate, as I constantly strive for improvement. However, those around me have often commented on my strong soft skills, including my ability to connect with people easily. Additionally, I'm known for my determination and intelligence



I ask will ask them in interview tomorrow. 

22.  Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it.
At my previous job, when I worked as a deputy technical support. My team and I came up with a gamification system that was designed to create a transparent way to evaluate their knowledge and motivate each employee to improve themselves.
As part of this project, my assistant and I created a concept from scratch, explained it to senior management and received the go-ahead. Next, together with the development department, we made this service available on the company’s internal network. As a result, this service received a huge response, increased employee productivity by more than 20% without increasing their salaries, it has been operating for more than 5 years and, as far as I know, is still in operation today.

7. Tell me about a time you were successful on a team
In fact, my main responsibility in my previous job was working with the team. My responsibilities included quality control, conflict resolution, and hiring and firing issues. And, like many companies, once every six months we had a review, which, including through anonymous employee reviews, allowed us to evaluate the quality of my work. And I had more than 90% positive feedback and not one negative one.

9. Describe your leadership style. 
I would describe my leadership style as participative and transformational. I believe in fostering a collaborative environment where team members feel empowered to contribute their ideas and expertise. I'm a firm believer in the strength of diverse perspectives and encourage open communication within the team.

Overall, my goal is to create a cohesive and high-performing team that not only achieves its objectives but also experiences professional growth and satisfaction in the process.

10. Why should we hire you? 
You should hire me because not only do my knowledge meet your requirements, but also because of my soft skills. I enjoy working in a team and my problem-solving, communication and skills align seamlessly with the requirements outlined in the job description. I am confident in my ability to bring a fresh perspective to the team and contribute to the continued success of your company.

14. What do you like to do outside of work?
Outside of work, I indulge in a couple of rewarding hobbies. I have a keen interest in shooting and editing videos. Additionally, I am passionate about playing percussion instruments, having undergone formal musical education in this domain. Occasionally, I enjoy collaborative musical sessions with friends at a rehearsal space. These activities not only serve as a source of personal enjoyment but also contribute to my overall sense of a work-ballance


15. Why did you leave your last job? / Why are you leaving your current position / Why do you want to work here?

While I’m grateful to my previous employer for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow in my career, I feel like, at that point, **I completely decided to go into the world of programming** and beause of this I had decided to make some career break. I **would love to** do something more **meaningful**and useful and get more involved into working on a diverse range of projects where I can **collaborate** with passionate people and learn new approaches and technologies. I would love to **work at** a **cutting-edge** company that tries to **make a positive impact** in the world.

I've noticed that often my conversation level changes depending on the day. It's like a sine wave, sometimes I'm on the crest and I'm somewhat confident in myself, and sometimes it's the opposite and I often stumble.
