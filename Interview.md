Rules to prepare:

1) **Be succinct, honest and engaging.**
I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.

2) **Use the job description to prepare.**
Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.

3) **Tie your story to their needs.**
People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.


- Tell me about yourself?
For the past three and a half years, I've been dedicated to learning programming, starting with Java. My interest in programming was sparked by my fascination with tasks like scripting and building SQL queries. In 2020, I took the opportunity to dive into the programming world, and I consider myself fortunate to have had a mentor with over 20 years of Java programming experience by my side. This mentor not only provided valuable guidance but also helped shape my approach to programming.

One of the most important lessons I learned from my mentor was the importance of seeking efficient solutions, embracing new technologies without bias, and delving into the core of any technology. Java, for instance, forms the foundation for many technologies.

In terms of my personal qualities, I prefer not to self-evaluate, as I constantly strive for improvement. However, those around me have often commented on my strong soft skills, including my ability to connect with people easily. Additionally, I'm known for my determination and intelligence
