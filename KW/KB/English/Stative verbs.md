# [[Stative verbs]]

Parent: [[English_Grammar]]

The following verbs are usually *stative* (rarely used in dynamic forms). Note that with many of these verbs, we perform the verb when we say it, so they are called ‘performatives’ (agree, admit, deny, promise, suggest)

Things of the *mind*, *states of the mind*
- doubt
- agree
- believe
- know
- understand
- recognize
- remember
- regret
- forget
- promise
- like
- love
- hate

*Perception:*
- see
- hear
- look
- sound*
- taste*

 `*` - If these verbs refer to the action, they become *dynamic*

*Possession:*
- have
- own
- owe
- possess
- belong
- weigh
- depend

*Desire:*
- want
