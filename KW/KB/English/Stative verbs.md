# [[Stative verbs]]

Parent: [[English_Grammar]]

The following verbs are usually *stative* (rarely used in dynamic forms). Note that with many of these verbs, we perform the verb when we say it, so they are called ‘performatives’ (agree, admit, deny, promise, suggest)

agree
desire

like, love, hate  (We use all 3 in continuous informally, but I would avoid doing so in formal English)
prefer
regret  (We do say ‘I am regretting...’ sometimes)
believe
know
find
realise
understand
admit / deny
suggest
notice
smell
belong
consist
contain
differ
depend
mean
own
owe
possess
seem
recognise
remember
forget
