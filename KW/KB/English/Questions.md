## Reported + Indirect Questions 

Both of these type of questions have the same rules:
- **NORMAL WORD ORDER**
- **if/whether** (no question word)
- no *auxiliary* - *do, does, did*
### Indirect questions

*Indirect questions* start with:
- Do you know + *if/whether* + he has a dog? - *Does he have a dog?*
- Could you tell me  where he lives? - *Where does he live?*
- Do you happen to know + *if/whether* + he has gone to the shops? - *Has he gone to the shops?*

If and whether used in *yes/no* questions. Whether - in more formal way.

### Reported questions
*Tenses move back*

- She asked me + *if/whether* + he *had* a car - *Does he have a car?*
- My teacher asked me + *if/whether* + I had done my work  - *Have you done your homework?*
- My mum asked  me *if/whether* + I had cut the grass - *Have you cut *
