# [[Interview preparing]]

## Personality
It is meant to *evaluate* my person trait

**Questions:**
- How would you characteristic yourself?
- How would you teammates describe you?
- What are the traits of personality that you think you have to work on?
- What are the traits you would like not to have?

## Hard Skills
Hard Skills are mostly checked during tech interviews, but if you are lucky and deal with a Teach HRM or Tech Recruiter, you're going to be asked some tech questions.

- Which framework do you use on you current project? What are its main events?
- What is 'responsive design'?
- What's the difference between SOAP and REST?
- Have you worked with any CMS?

**Golden Circle by Simon Sinek** - technic that can help to answer the question and *get ahead* in the interview
