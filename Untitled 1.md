# Trade Union: Full-Stack Spring Boot and React Application

## Overview
A comprehensive full-stack web application built using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. In this project, I tried to implement a table view and the ability to process information using tables.

## Features
  - User authentication and authorization. With different roles and permissions (the same Roles can have different permissions)
  - CRUD operations for managing data
  - Table view of data
  - Custom validation logic

## Technologies Used
- List the technologies and tools used in your project. For example:
  - Backend:
    - Spring Boot
    - Spring Security (JWT)
    - Hibernate
    - PostgreSQL
    - Flyway migration
  - Frontend:
    - React
    - DevExpress

## Project Roadmap and Issues

### Current Issues
- ðŸ“ŒÐ•he frontend of the application lacks proper exception handling, which leads to poor user experience when unexpected errors occur.

### Refactoring and Optimization

- ðŸ“Œ Rewrite State Manager to Redux - Currently, the state management in the frontend is done using `useContext`, which can lead to performance issues and complex code. We should refactor the state management to use Redux for better organization and scalability.
- ðŸ“Œ Frontend Code Refactoring - Refactor frontend code to improve maintainability and reduce spaghetti  code O-o. 

## Getting Started
To get started with the Full-Stack Spring Boot and React Application, follow the steps below:
### Installation
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed
2. **Node.js**: Install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager)
3. **PostgreSQL Database**: Install PostgreSQL on your system, and set up a database for the application
4. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-spring-react.git
cd fullstack-spring-react
```

### Configuration
2. Create an `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory based on the provided `application.properties.template`. Replace the placeholders `${DB_USERNAME}`, `${DB_PASSWORD}`, and `${JWT_SECRET}` with your PostgreSQL database username, password, and JWT secret respectively.
3. Set up environment variables:
- On Unix-based systems (Linux or macOS):
```bash
export DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
export DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
export JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```
- On Windows:
```bash
set DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
set DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
set JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

4. Install frontend dependencies and build the React application:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### Running the Application

Now you're all set to run the full-stack application:

1. Start the Spring Boot backend server (if you haven't already):

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:8090.

2. Start the React frontend server:
`cd frontend npm start`

The frontend server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
