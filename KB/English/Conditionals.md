# [[Conditionals]]

Parent: [[English_grammar]]


 
- ## [[–£—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ 0-–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ (Conditional 1)]]
	IF *PRESENT/ PRESENT*
	
	üî¥ always true
		üìå If water reaches 100, it boils
		üìå If you press this button, the machine gives you coffee

- ## [[–£—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ 1-–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ (Conditional 1)]] - REAL

	IF *PRESENT (any time) / Will* or *won't* or [[Modal]] or *imperative*+ *inf* 
	- Instead *if* we sometimes can use:
		- when (+ [[Present Pefect|present perfect]])
		- before

		üìå If I pass my exams, I will celebrate 
		üìå When I am 65, I will retire

**–î–ª—è 2-–≥–æ –∏ 3-–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å –æ–±—â–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞:**
	- Instead *if* we sometimes can use:
		- provided, providing (that)
		- as long as
		- on condition that
		- supposing (that)
	- *Inversion* - we can switch the first part of *if condition*
- ## [[–£—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ 2-–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ (Conditional 2)]] - UNREAL


	IF *PAST SIMPLE OR PAST CONTINIUS/ Would* or *wouldn't*
	
	üî¥ Unlikely (hypothetical) present or future
		üìå If I won a million, I would buy a yacht
		
- ## [[–£—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ 3-–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ (Conditional 3) - unreal in the past]]

	IF *PAST PERFECT SIMPLE OR PAST PERFECT CONTINIUS/ Would* or *wouldn't* *have* + *3rd* 

	üî¥ Unreal past
		üìå If I had gone to university, I would have got the job
		üìå **With Inversion (the same meaning):** Had I gone to university, I would have got the job
