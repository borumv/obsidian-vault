### DocStrings in [[üìôPython]]
–í *—Ç—Ä—ë—Ö –∫–æ–≤—ã—á–∫–∞—Ö* –º—ã –∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ–º —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—à–∞ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏—è –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç, it's named **DocStrings**. It's very useful to documentation our own code. With methoid **__doc__** I can find out, what this operation do.

**'Dart Vaider'** - is a default parametr of this function. It was used when we don't point out parametrs in our function
```python
def sayHello(name = 'Dart Vaider'):
    '''
    This function should print greeting
    '''
    print(f'hello {name}')


sayHello()
sayHello('Boris')
print(sayHello.__doc__)
```
